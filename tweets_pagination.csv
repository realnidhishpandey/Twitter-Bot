@TwitterSupport,"We had big hopes for Fleets, but now it’s time to say goodbye and take flight with other ideas. Starting August 3, Fleets will no longer be available. More on what we learned and what's coming (1/4)"
@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"
@TwitterSupport,We learned a lot from Fleets and we’re excited to focus on newer and better ways to start conversations on Twitter. We’re proud of the work so far and have no plans of slowing down. (3/4)
@TwitterSupport,"Taking big chances helps us make the best product possible for you, but it doesn't always work out like we planned. It’s not always easy to say goodbye to a feature like Fleets, but we’re excited to get back to work on what we’ve got planned next: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets.html… (4/4)"
@ladyofacat,"Please let us have multiple gifs per tweet I’m begging on my knees. It would be such a popular feature, everyone would love it especially me"
@TwitterSupport,"Hi, Anita. We appreciate your suggestion and will send your feedback to the team."
@fluffykittensox,I’m impressed that you have actually taken note of what didn’t work and also listened to the populace. Thank you for that it’s appreciated.
@TwitterSupport,
@PBTyrrell,"I love it, removal is critical in great design. Well done."
@Cally246,Can we have a way to be able to see interactions between accounts? Like if you click on someone’s profile you can see if you’ve interacted before?
@TwitterSupport,"Hey Cally. Thanks for the suggestion, we'll share this with our larger team for consideration."
@IAmJenMcG,"It’d be cool if you took a swing at getting rid of nazis and anti-vaxers but I get it, priorities"
@1stMarsColonist,Can we get better notification AI?
@s_u_n_j_a_y,
@RobRobbEdwards,Twitter have restricted my account for over 12 months now and I can't get a response You say you are here to help but you do nothing
@elfhybrid_,Literally all we want is for you guys to mod more and actually kick out the nazis and the people who harass us the SINGULARLY ONLY THING
@krysxpp2,"Hi @TwitterSupport i've been following @krysxpp for long time, this user has never done anything to violate twitter rules. It's suspended w/no email notice. Could u please consider&unsuspend it? She appealed the restriction via case no. #0215097024 bt still no response, TIA."
@BackupKy1e,"Hi @TwitterSupport , I filed a DMCA counter-notification over 10 days ago and never got a notice. This means that my account (@Ky1eWRLD) should have been unsuspended. However, it is still locked. Please unlock my account because it is now in good standing. Case # 0203668923"
@ItemsENABLED,Still waiting for the edit button
@ Dreamhack SD,"What about Super Follows, Spaces, and other upcoming products?"
@jkkcult,"Please @TwitterSupport Can u unblock my acc @jikookculture ? I really didn't violated any Twitter rules, I am having issues to reset my password cause I don't have email registred to it, just phone number, and it doesn't work. Please help me, this acc it's really important to me!"
@iHasan_7,Goodbye fleets I don't like it anyway
@annmarimaukonen,"I wish it was as easy to say Goodbye to all those bullies on Twitter, but they seem only to get like a 12hrs suspended account. Then they're at it again."
@mariaholley,An edit button would make us happy :)
@bruttafica,How about a edit option?!!!
@dognamedblue,Been here since '08 a no nothing about Fleet... there might be the problem... ?
@DAVIDKATZ_,Twitter help me I need help I have problems.
@VikingLander11,How about something that blocks tweets from Americans? I am in Canada and I get a lot of stuff from American sites and my trending and topics to follow are mostly American centered. Honestly? Could use a little less USA in my Twitter.
@CheNePensi_HahQ,@TwitterSupport Free @iostocondifra #0174477236 ................................................................................................................................................
@themrvels,Hi @TwitterSupport my account @caroldenvrs got suspended could you please consider and unsuspend it? I appealed the suspension via the Help Center form but obtained no response. Case #0197146719 and #0210740369
@dahlila,Buh-bye.
@4kchpjm,#TwitterUnmuteJimin Please unmute Jimin’s name it’s been years already
@nbranche,Interesting. I hope @Twitter doesn’t kill off voice tweets before I get to try it…that feature launched before fleets and I never got around to fleeting
user,text
@althel7,احسن، بعضهم كل يوم ينزل كومة تغريدات ويصور تغريداته ويحطها فلييت! باقي يلاحق فيها الناس في الشوارع نشوف تغريداته. وشكله يرسل على قروبات الواتساب روابط تغريداته وفي الحالة على الواتساب
@dumbledong,Hey @twittersupport my business account (580k) was suspended due to false copyright claims @ellebrookeuk . I successfully appealed all claims and was told after 10 business days my account would be reinstated. I still haven’t obtained any response. Please help #0211860185
@TwitterSupport,Thanks for sticking with us. We're experiencing a rise in cases and our team is working quickly to respond as soon as they can.
@Thunder_Owl,Thank You for throwing that out.
@BriEscobarC,"Editar tuits, no es complicado"
@chaoaretasty,Please give me the space back that the fleets took up rather than replace what you show there
@ThomBartley,"Please don’t pull a @mosseri and hit us with a “we’re not longer a short message sharing app”. Insta lost its way because all it does is steal other people’s ideas (Stories = worked, push towards video / shopping doesn’t) Hope you come up with something original / good"
@SmileItsKT,bloody good. hate fleets. pointless addition.
@lordfpx,"Finally, That was taking too much space on my screen."
@SkatesSongs,Thank you for listening. I use twitter because I like words. Not for pictures. The changes to the trending topics have been brilliant and are very much appreciated
@GatitaKicksAss,"Thank you for the update. Learning is a process. How about that ""Edit"" button?"
@Kathleenhamil15,"Fleets, we hardly knew ye..."
@Icebox551,maybe stop removing shit and actually implement an edit tweet
@NaSa2013NaSa,Thank you for undisturbing enduser Best decision you have ever made
@mikequinn_,Open up your API to third party clients like @tweetbot and you’ll get more adaption.
@joelvmills,"I’d like to see recent tweets in time order. When reading Twitter around an activity or event news, sport or whatever I want to see up to date commentary not yesterday’s tweets. The ICYMI function was better than a jumbled chronology."
@nhfabioo,Something is not working on my twitter account! I can't see the most engaged tweets when I click on the TOP section. Instead it shows the most recent ones! Help me!
@Let_Anita,Does that mean everyone will get the Spaces Tab before then? Or how will they know which Spaces are live when not in Fleets?
@redmeister81,Blue ticks for all. Sorted
@SweetyGogoi6,Why my this tweet is unavailable it's not any hate or other words i have used requesting you to please ger my tweet available and the reason why unavailable i have not used any bad word or tweeted any hate speech
@mcclure111,"Okay but let us remove the fleets bar, it sounds like you're just going to leave a list of ""spaces"" there and I don't want to see a list of ""spaces"" either"
@lalita_xsiempr,"Hello, please reactivate my account. is @yacque_espos I was suspended for copyright by mistake"
@TampaWoman1965,Can you provide a system for vaccine and political disinformation?
@kgradyback2life,Edit. Option. One that tracks original tweet so their are always receipts. Please and thank you!
@Ouma_Ogutu,I never found them useful or even meaningful. Thank you for taking them away.
@timtfj,"Whatever else you do add, please can you ensure that all users can access it? Fleets are inaccessible via the mobile website, to the extent that I thought they were an off-Twitter thing."
@_garud_a,Give us back Moments for smartphones users.
@hybridmoments97,Might be a good idea to look into better ways to remove the racists and trolls from your platform. That would help make it a safer place for shy posters.
@shawnwenzel,"A feature I would love to see is a ""tweet sunset"" where tweets older than a year or two are only visible to you or people you follow unless you retweet them again. Would prevent trolls from digging up old tweets like recently happened to @itskerrii"
@Erick_O_Mokua,"That is a sober,great http://move.How about giving us a character limit of say 250 per tweet instead of somebody doing so many tweets explaining a topical issue?It will be a great move I believe."
@CatholicJosh122,An edit button. Now. Signed - LITERALLY. EVERYONE
@MibIH,So maybe now you'll give us the Edit button every Twitter user has been crying out for since day one?

@Laer_Cito,"Why taking out fleets? Everyone used them their own way, it was a nice feature. Just let them have music and they would be perfect, really. But anyway, you manage things around here, so, we'll just miss them. Go for an interesting alternative, yeah? Pls? #notwithoutfleets"
@RaeCorson,Farewell fleeting feature
@3badista,Thank god
@Incalculable888,Twitter for close friends seems like it will be promising
@Des_Caters,
,"Hey I've been using Twitter since 2008. It's ok.Sometimes things don't go well. You know what, we need edit function. I prefer simpler Twitter as it was a decade ago. It'd be much better for us users to fully control our TL. Don't mess it around. Let's make a better Twitterland!"
@PurpleT100,"Please put the timeline back to how it was before fleets, and don't fill it with Spaces instead. I've chosen to not use apps that are like your Spaces, so I don't want them on Twitter. Put then where those who use them have access, but out of the way of those who don't."
@PurpleT100,"The blog me tions ""full screen vertical ads"". Please don't. We accept you need ads, but the more they annoy us, like in full screen, the less likely many of us will use the app. Subtlety, rather than IN YA FACE, works far better."
@Seabulll,"Dear @ilyabr0wn I read your article about fleets. I realize that it's not given much importance, other networks remind you all the time that the person posted a status, here I never remember that it exists... That's missing! Fleet serves to show what worries me a lot right now."
@MrlgPerez,How about you bring back fleets. Don't refresh for us. How about a edit feature? That would be great.
